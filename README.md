# Charging_Platoon_Scheduling_Single_Route
we aim to co-optimize the platooning and charging strategies of EFVs. To achieve this goal, we developed a mixed-integer linear programming model to minimize the total system costs, including en-route charging cost, delivery delay cost, and hub charging cost.
